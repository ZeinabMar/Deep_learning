# Deep Learning Essentials

In this repository, we delve into fundamental deep learning concepts and implement detailed examples for each. The focus areas include:

## Topics Covered
- **Activation Functions**: Implementation and comparison of various activation functions used in neural networks.
- **Subclass Model**: Understanding and creating custom models using subclassing in TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizing pre-trained models to transfer knowledge to new tasks.
- **Initialization**: Examining initialization methods for neural network weights.
- **Regression and Classification Models**: Building both regression and classification models, covering end-to-end implementations.

Each topic is implemented with **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for hands-on exploration.
